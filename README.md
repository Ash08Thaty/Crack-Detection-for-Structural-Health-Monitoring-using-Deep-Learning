# Crack-Detection-for-Structural-Health-Monitoring-using-Deep-Learning

Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. In this series of labs, you learn everything you need to efficiently build a classifier using a pre-trained model that would detect cracks in images of concrete. For problem formulation, we will denote images of cracked concrete as the positive class and images of concrete with no cracks as the negative class.
